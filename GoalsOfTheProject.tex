\paragraph{Bootstrapping.} We need a process to create an autonomous kernel and to bootstrap it into a new image. This process has to be modular in order to be able to create a specific kernel.
This kernel has to be autonomous which means it has to be isolated from the other classes and can only refer to itself.

\paragraph{Dealing with kernel changes.}
Pharo development is real active in all parts of the system and in particularly the kernel. Therefore it is not possible to take 6 or 8 months to just bootstrap it.
We need a solution that can cope with the continuous changes and fixes in the kernel. 


\paragraph{}Therefore we will attack the problem from two angles: (1) cleaning the current kernel to ease the bootstrap, (2) building a bootstrap process that can be applied to the evolving kernel.
