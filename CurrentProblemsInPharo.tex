The current structure of \gls{Pharo} is a problem for creating easily a bootstrap at different levels:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \gls{Pharo} has still monolithic structure with a lot of old code (even though all our efforts are on that);
	\item There is structural hidden dependencies requiring deep analysis to be revealed. For example, Stream depends on Compiler while it should be the inverse;
	\item The definition of the \gls{Pharo}'s kernel is fuzzy and dispatched through different packages which aren't autonomous and self contained.
\end{itemize}
