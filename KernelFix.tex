In order to reduce the amount of bad dependencies during the kernel isolation (see section~\ref{KernelIsolation} page~\pageref{KernelIsolation}).

\goal Minimise Pharo kernel dependencies by fixing classes to ease the Hazel kernel isolation.

\problems 
\begin{itemize}
	\item How to identify bad dependencies ?
	\item How to fix them ?
\end{itemize}

\solutions
\begin{itemize}
	\item To identify bad dependencies, we have used \gls{Moose} on \gls{Pharo} 1.2 and have manually flag each dependencies.
	\item To fix them there is no magic formula, we have spent time on it, and we are far from having fix all bad dependencies. But a bug entry was opened on the developers platform for each bad dependence.
\end{itemize}

\inanutshell 20 dependencies have already been fixed, but 40 bug entries are still open waiting for a fix.
