Here the topic is the same that the previous one. We want to flag dependencies in order to isolate modules, but here it's for the whole system.

\goal Analyze (and fix) all \gls{Pharo} bad dependencies in order to have isolated modules easily pluggable and un-pluggable and not circular references in class initialization.

\problems 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Which tool to use to analyze a whole system ?
	\item How to automatize the creation of a new bug entry ?
	\item How to break circular references ?
\end{itemize}

\solutions 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Moose have been used here too to build a tool that flag Pharo packages dependencies (about 1300 dependencies);
	\item We haven't found how to use the Google interface to automatize the creation of bug entries, so we have to add each bad dependence one by hand.
	\item To break circular references, there is no automatic answer. Each case has to be analyzed and deeply understood before being fixed.
\end{itemize}

\inanutshell Now that all the bad dependencies are flagged, it's easier to focus on important things to fix.
